# DESCRIPTION 

The application is developed for a company that works with sensors that they measures temperatures, humidity. 
UI is designed on Qt Designer and developed in Python 3 with PyQt5 module. 

# MISSINGS
There are still some missings. For instance, I have not add dynamical sensor addition,
also light sensor settings is not configured.

# ATTENTION 
I used JSON data for getting temperature values from sensor,
so you need to add your own JSON link in config file under the ".py files" folder to sensor1source variable.

Also you need to set your own firebase database connections in the config file.
